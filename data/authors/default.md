# Project Goals

The goal of the proposed project is to estimate the potential impact of the SAFE-T Act on bond
court outcomes and pretrial release, pretrial detention and jail populations, and the lengths and
costs of pretrial detention in Illinois using data from several local and state sources. Given the
lack of data needed to fully estimate these impacts, the project will use existing statewide data to
produce estimates for the statewide impact and supplement these data with more detailed
information from five specific counties in Illinois.

# About the Center

The Center’s mission is to promote fair, informed, effective and ethical approaches to criminal justice policy and practice through collaborative interdisciplinary research and evaluation, professional leadership development, and targeted projects designed to bring about systemic improvements in Illinois’ criminal justice system.
