This research brief examines trends in the number of individuals arrested and eligible for detention under the PFA. The analyses were produced in collaboration with the Illinois Sentencing Policy Advisory Council (SPAC) using data from the Illinois State Police’s Criminal History Record Information (CHRI). These data include information for every individual arrested in Illinois from 2017 to 2021. Given the limited amount of statewide data in Illinois, understanding such trends in the volume and characteristics of defendants eligible for pretrial detention or supervision is a starting point to estimating and planning for the potential impact of the PFA.


# Which Individuals Are Detainable under the PFA?

Under the PFA there are two groups of individuals who are detainable: 1) those eligible based on a “public safety” standard, and 2) those eligible based on a “willful flight” standard. The public safety standard allows for the pretrial detention of individuals charged with specific, detainable offenses who are found to pose a risk to public safety. [2](#2)  The specific detainable offenses under this standard can be categorized broadly into three groups: 1) non-probationable forcible felonies and sex offenses, 2) weapon offenses (primarily illegal firearm possession), and 3) domestic violence offenses and violations of orders of protection. The willful flight standard allows for the pretrial detention of individuals shown to be a risk for willful flight from prosecution who are charged with either 1) a detention eligible offense under the public safety standard or 2) any Class 3 Felony or more serious felony offense. [3](#3)


<Background>
The PFA essentially prohibits pretrial detention for most individuals arrested in Illinois. There are just 79 offenses that are detainable under the public safety standard. Although a larger group may be detainable under the willful flight standard, the law requires prosecutors to prove an individual arrested is a risk of willful flight; and even then, the law is limited to those charged with a Class 3 felony or higher. Individuals arrested for any other offense in Illinois will not be detainable once the law takes effect. That means nearly all individuals arrested for a Class 4 felony or misdemeanor will not be detainable.

# How Many Arrests Involve a Detainable Offense?

To examine the volume of arrests for detainable offenses, the analyses looked at two time periods: 2017-2019 (pre-COVID) and 2020-2021 (post-COVID). [4](#4)  The average number of arrests for detainable offenses under the public safety standard remained relatively stable: between 2017 and 2019, there were roughly 47,000 arrests for detainable offenses per year, compared to approximately 44,000 arrests per year in 2020 and 2021 – a drop of just 7% . The number of arrests for detainable offenses under the willful flight standard decreased nearly 24%, decreasing slightly from roughly 34,000 arrests per year to 26,000 arrests per year. In contrast, the number of arrests that included only non-detainable offenses decreased markedly – nearly 50% -- from roughly 170,000 arrests per year between 2017 and 2019 to approximately 90,000 arrests per year in 2020 and 2021.

<br></br>


As a result of these different trends, the proportion of all arrests that were detainable under the public safety standard increased from 19% in 2017-2019 to 27% in 2020-2021. By comparison, the proportion of arrests that were detainable under the willful flight standard remained stable at 15% to 17%. However, the proportion of arrests that included only non-detainable offenses decreased from 66% of arrests between 2017 and 2019 to 56% of arrests between 2020 and 2021.

<br></br>

<Background>

While the number of individuals arrested for non-detainable offenses decreased during the post-COVID period, the large majority of individuals arrested in Illinois continue to be arrested for non-detainable offenses. In 2020/2021, 73% of individuals were arrested for offenses that were non-detainable under the public safety standard; 56% were arrested for offenses that were non-detainable under either the public safety or willful flight standard. If post-COVID trends continue, that means somewhere between 89,000 and 115,000 individuals per year would not be detained under the PFA. If pre-COVID trends return, 66% to 85% of individuals arrested will be arrested for non-detainable offenses; that means somewhere between 172,000 and 207,000 individuals per year not be detained under the PFA. Put another way, somewhere between 44,000 and 70,000 individuals will be detainable once the PFA takes effect.

# What Are the Most Common Detainable Offenses?

Since it is unclear what arrest patterns may look like going forward, we combined both the pre- and post-COVID periods to examine the proportion of arrests for detainable and non-detainable offenses. We also looked more closely at the most common detainable offenses for which individuals were arrested. When looking at the entire period from 2017-2021, roughly 12% of arrests for detainable offenses under the public safety standard involved arrests for non-probationable forcible felonies and sex offenses; an additional 18% involved arrests for firearm possession offenses. The large majority of detainable arrests under the public safety standard – nearly 70% -- involved arrests for domestic violence offenses or violations of an order of protection; and nearly all of these domestic violent offenses and violations of orders of protection involved misdemeanor offenses. Thus, the large majority of individuals arrested for offenses detainable under the public safety standard were not arrested for forcible felonies, sex offenses, or weapons offenses; rather, they were arrested for misdemeanors.

<br></br>
 
When considering all arrests, just 3% involved arrests for non-probationable forcible felonies and sex offenses, just 4% involved arrests for firearm possession  offenses, and 15% involved arrests for domestic violence offenses or violations of an order of protection. An additional 15% involved arrests for offenses detainable under the willful flight standard. As noted above, 63% of arrests involved offenses that were non-detainable under either standard.

<br></br>

<Background>

Individuals arrested for domestic violent make up the large majority of those arrested for detainable offenses (70%) and make up a fairly large proportion of all individuals arrested in Illinois (15%). On an annual basis, that translates to almost 33,000 arrests for domestic violence across the state – arrests that would be eligible for pre-trial detention consideration under the PFA. When similar analyses were performed for each individual judicial circuit in Illinois the same pattern was found: arrests for domestic violence offenses or violations of an order of protection accounted for the majority of arrests for detainable offenses, ranging from 60% to 85% of all detainable offenses across the circuits

# What Are the Risks of New Charges and Failure to Appear (FTA) of Those Arrested?

While the PFA lists specific offenses that are detainable either under the public safety or willful flight standards, not all individuals arrested for such an offense will be detained - the law requires prosecutors to file a motion for detention and requires judges to state a reason for detention if imposed. One possible way to estimate what proportion of individuals may be detained is to examine individuals’ risk of new criminal activity and risk of failure to appear – two criteria that may be used to impose pre-trial detention. The Public Safety Assessment (PSA) provides criminal justice practitioners with information that can inform pretrial decisions, using current charge and criminal history to determine individuals’ risk of new criminal activity and risk of failure to appear while on pretrial release. [5](#5)

The large majority – 69% to 75% -- of those arrested for detainable offenses under the public safety standard were not at high risk of new criminal activity. Just 25% to 31% of defendants had an elevated risk for new criminal activity.  In turn, 87% to 91% were not at high risk of failure to appear; again, just 9% to 13% had an elevated risk of failure to appear.

Among individuals arrested for offenses detainable under the willful flight standard, 82% were not at high risk of failure to appear; just 18% had an elevated risk for failure to appear; however, the PSA does not distinguish between willful flight risk and the more broad failure to appear.

<br></br>

<Background>
The large majority of individuals arrested for detainable offenses under the public safety standard do not have an elevated risk of new criminal activity. Of the roughly 5,400 individuals arrested each year for non-probationable felonies or sex offenses, 69% - or 3,700 individuals – are not at high risk of new criminal activity. Similarly, of the roughly 8,100 individuals arrested for firearm possession offenses, 72% - 5,800 individuals – are not at high risk of new criminal activity. Finally, of the roughly 33,000 individuals arrested for firearm possession offenses, 75% - 25,000 individuals – are not at high risk of new criminal activity. Combined, of the roughly 45,000 individuals arrested each year for a detainable offense under the public safety standard, 34,500 do not have a high risk of new criminal activity; this may mean that just 10,500 individuals arrested for detainable offenses under the public safety standard will be detained once the PFA takes effect.

The large majority of individuals arrested for detainable offenses under the willful flight standard do not have an elevated risk of failure to appear. Of the roughly 26,000 individuals arrested each year 82% - 21,000 individuals – are not at high risk of failure to appear. This may mean that just 5,000 individuals arrested for detainable offenses under the willful flight standard will be detained once the PFA takes effect.

# Conclusion

Each year, roughly 45,000 arrests occur in Illinois for offenses that are detention-eligible under the public safety standard of the PFA. Most of these arrests – 33,000 per year – are for domestic violence or violations of an order of protection. When public safety consideration is combined with willful flight consideration, roughly 37% of all arrests in Illinois are at least potentially eligible for a detention consideration, although given the relatively low risk for new violent criminal activity and low risk of FTA, only a portion of these cases will likely have a detention hearing sought and detention ultimately granted.



### Methodology 


Using the Illinois State Police’s Criminal History Record Information (CHRI) data, SPAC identified every adult arrested in Illinois from 2017 to 2021. This resulted in the identification of roughly 1.1 million unique arrest events. For each of these arrest events, the data were then examined to determine if any of the arrest charges would be eligible for pretrial detention under the PFA’s “public safety standard.” Within the PFA there are specific crimes enumerated that, if charged, make an individual eligible to be petitioned by the county State’s Attorney for a detention hearing, and if a hearing is granted by the judge, to be held in detention pretrial. Loyola and SPAC identified roughly 400 specific statute references for these detainable offenses, and grouped them into three broad categories, including: 1) non-probationable forcible felonies and sex offenses, 2) weapon offenses (primarily illegal firearm possession crimes, and 3) domestic violence and violating an order of protection offenses.

1. The PFA is part of a larger, omnibus crime bill (House Bill 3653) known as the Safety, Accountability, Fairness and Equity Act (or SAFE-T Act). Signed into law by Governor J.B. Pritzker on February 22, 2021 (PA 101-0652), the omnibus bill affects policing, victim compensation programs, prison sentencing credits, post-prison supervision, and pretrial release practices in the state. [Letter_Bill 1..764](ilga.gov)

2. 725 ILCS 5/110-6.1(a). For an individual to be detained, the State’s Attorney must file a motion to detain; a detention then would be held during which a judge would evaluate the individual’s risk and determine if detention was warranted. 
<a name="2"></a>
3. 725 ILCS 5/110-6.1(a)(7) “Upon verified petition by the State, the court shall hold a hearing and may deny a defendant pretrial release only if:… (7)the person has a high likelihood of willful flight to avoid prosecution and is charged with: (A) Any felony described in Section (a)(1) through (a)(5) of this Section; or (B) A felony offense other than a Class 4 offense.”

4. We count the entire period from January 2020 through December 2021 as “post-COVID.” Initial analyses found that this period was markedly different from the period from 2017-2019, in terms of both arrests and cases processing. The term “post-COVID” is not meant to signify a period after COVID restrictions were lifted; rather, it is meant to signify a period in which the pandemic and pandemic responses altered social interactions, crime, and responses to crime.

5. The analyses did not have access to actual PSA risk assessment scores; however, we were able to create “proxy” risk scores using this tool and the Illinois State Police’s CHRI data. Elevated risk for new criminal activity meant that the nature of the current arrest charge, age, and the extent and nature of prior convictions indicated an elevated risk of subsequent criminal activity during pretrial release. Elevated risk of failure to appear meant that the nature of the current arrest charge, age, extent and nature of prior convictions, and prior failures to appear indicated an elevated risk of failure to appear if released. For the current analyses, a score of 4 or more on the risk of new criminal activity or failure to appear was considered high risk. This elevated risk does not mean that these individuals will commit new crimes or fail to appear if released, but that the risk is higher than those without this indication.
